name: transition metal ion transport
namespace: biological_process
def: "The directed movement of transition metal ions into, out of or within a cell, or between cells, by means of some agent such as a transporter or pore. A transition metal is an element whose atom has an incomplete d-subshell of extranuclear electrons, or which gives rise to a cation or cations with an incomplete d-subshell. Transition metals often have more than one valency state. Biologically relevant transition metals include vanadium, manganese, iron, copper, cobalt, nickel, molybdenum and silver." [ISBN:0198506732]
